## 📊 Analysis Steps

1. **Load Data** – Import the dataset (`student-mat.csv`) from the `data/` folder.  
2. **Data Exploration** – Check dataset shape, data types, and missing values.  
3. **Visualizations** – Generate plots such as:
   - Distribution of Final Grades  
   - Gender vs Final Grades  
   - Study Time vs Final Grades  
   - Absences vs Final Grades  
   - Correlation Heatmap  
4. **Save Results** – All plots are automatically saved in the `results/plots/` folder.  
5. **Summary** – Document insights and conclusions.

## 🔑 Key Findings

1. **Grade Distribution**: Most students scored between 12 and 15 in final grades.  
2. **Gender vs Final Grades**: Both male and female students performed similarly, with no major differences.  
3. **Study Time vs Final Grades**: Students who studied more tended to achieve slightly higher grades.  
4. **Absences vs Final Grades**: Higher absences were linked to lower grades.  
5. **Correlation Heatmap**: Strong positive correlation between G1, G2, and G3 (previous and final grades).

## 📌 Conclusion

- Study time and regular attendance improve final grades.  
- Gender does not significantly impact academic performance.  
- Early grades (G1, G2) are good predictors of final performance (G3).
